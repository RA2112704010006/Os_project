SERVER-CLIENT SECURE CHAT (AND FILE TRANSFER) CODE:
The code above includes secure file transfer as well as messaging options.The security provided by the code is based on encryption and decryption using cryptographic systems namely AES and DES.Also the keys provided in the above code are based on RSA cryptosystem and keys are generated such that integrity is maintained and authenticity is also maintained using RSA Digital Signature.

PREREQUISITES:
The code works in Java environment.Thus a Java code compiler is the basic requirement to make the  code function.

RUNNING THE TESTS:
The code gives the user an option to choose between client-server chat or file transfer.The user can choose accordingly.Also the user can choose between the type of encryption to be choosed.It can be either AES or DES.

Chat-
The chat option includes transfer of simple messages between the client and the server.These messages are encrypted/decrypted using the technique chosen.

File transfer-
The code can transfer files upto size 100Mb(tested) between client and server.The file thus transfered is encrypted/decrypted using the techniques mentioned. 

DEPLOYMENT:
The project requires a Text file to be created to run and test the encryption/decryption.
